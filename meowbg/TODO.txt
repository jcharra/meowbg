BUGS:

On FIBS, match events/dice events do not cause the
possible moves to be calculated

Starting new AI game after online game causes errors
=> finalize matches correctly, especially online stuff

"New Ai game" registers new players each time ...

Endgame Event shows old score

Dice do not change to other field when dancing
Dice do not show at dice events

Moves are not animated on FIBS




TODOs:

 - Widget playground
 - Settings Panel
 - Popups for
    o Resign accept
    o Invitation (match length?)
    o Player dropped connection
 - Chat
 - Improve cube looks
